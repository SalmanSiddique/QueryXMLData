        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      
        Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
        and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
        teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
        meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
        Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
        over all.
      
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
        the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
        oven till bubbly.
      
        Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
        stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
        and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!
      </td><td>
      Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
      tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
      mozzarella till the last minute.

        Roll out 2 of the balls to fit into the pie pans. Do not make the crust too thick

        strips for the top of the crust. Alternately you can use cookie cutters and

          In a large bowl, cut 6 tablespoons of the butter into the flour with 
          a pastry blender until the butter is more or less incorporated. Now 
          coarsely cut the remaining butter into the flour mixture, leaving many 
          visible pieces of butter (about 1/4 inch in diameter should be fine).

          Dissolve the salt into the ice water. Slowly drizzle the salted water 
          into the flour mixture while tossing gently with a fork. When all the water

          Empty the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. By folding up the 
          four sides of the wrap and pressing, form a rectangle of dough. Roll the
          dough out just a bit and fold the sides over the middle, forming a piece 
          one third the former size. Repeat, this time folding the top and bottom
          to the middle. The butter and flour will not yet be working in harmony, so 
          you will probably have to use the plastic wrap to aid you in the first
          few folds.

          Puff pastry requires a somewhat Calvinist submission of the will and a 
          confidence that layers will appear. Roll the dough out again and repeat the
          folding, lightly dusting with flour between every layer. Discard the plastic 
          wrap as soon as the dough holds together on its own.

          The dough will become progressively softer as you work on it, with an almost 
          springy texture. After 6 or 10 repetitions of the folding and rolling, cut the 
          dough into 18 equal pieces. Wrap each well in plastic wrap and let rest in the 
          refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

        Cut the stack of phyllo sheets in half and lay between two damp, clean

        to a diameter of 6 to 8 inches. Set aside.Place about 1/2 cup of the chicken 
        mixture into a half sheet of phyllo and wrap like an egg roll into a neat, 
        tight package. Place the phyllo-wrapped chicken on the rolled dough, and brush 
        the egg white around it.
      
        Fold the bottom of the dough up onto the phyllo to form the foot of the 
        coffin. Then fold up the sides and top of the dough, pinching it together 
        to make a cross shape on the top. Repeat for each sarcophage. Cover and
        chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
      
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush the pastry with egg white and bake 
        for 15 minutes, or till golden brown. 18 servings.
